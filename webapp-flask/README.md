# Quick start guide
Please refer to the `utils` directory.
For windows, use the `run_app.ps1` script.
For mac/linux, use the `run_app.sh` script.

Utimately the goal will be to use the **Dockerfile** currently contained and lean on tagging images with the commit ID, but the quick start scripts are sufficient for early development.
